# **exploreNHANSES**

### **Author**
Justyna Jankowiak

### **Description**
This package has been created to explore a subset of [NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm) publication, drawing attention to the prevalence of exercise and associated health effects across different demographics. The functions provided with a package allow to explore and visualize data from the survey conducted between 2013 and 2014.

### **How to use?**
You can use package functions directly or you can explore their functionalities by exploring an Shiny application included in the package:

```{r}
exploreNHANES::run_app()
```

The ready-to-use application is also available on [my shinyapps.io website](https://jjankowiak.shinyapps.io/explorenhanes-app/).
